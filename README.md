# Algorithms
* In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a sequence of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation.

* In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

* Algorithms in c++

* Stacks - In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:
    * Push - which adds an element to the collection
    * Pop - which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.


* Queue - In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence
* Deque - In computer science, a double-ended queue (abbreviated to deque) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail). It is also often called a head-tail linked list.
