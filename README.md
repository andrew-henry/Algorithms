# Algorithms
* In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a sequence of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation.

* In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

* Algorithms in c++

Data Structures

* Stacks - In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:
    * Push - which adds an element to the collection
    * Pop - which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.


* Queue - In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence
* Deque - In computer science, a double-ended queue (abbreviated to deque) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail). It is also often called a head-tail linked list.
* Singly Linked List - In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.
* Doubly Linked List - In computer science, a doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields: two link fields and one data field. The beginning and ending nodes' previous and next links, respectively, point to some kind of terminator, typically a sentinel node or null, to facilitate traversal of the list.
