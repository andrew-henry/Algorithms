# Algorithms
* In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a sequence of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation.

* In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

* Algorithms in c++

Data Structures

* Stacks - In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:
    * Push - which adds an element to the collection
    * Pop - which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.


* Queue - In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence
* Deque - In computer science, a double-ended queue (abbreviated to deque) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail). It is also often called a head-tail linked list.
* Singly Linked List - In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.
* Doubly Linked List - In computer science, a doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields: two link fields and one data field. The beginning and ending nodes' previous and next links, respectively, point to some kind of terminator, typically a sentinel node or null, to facilitate traversal of the list.

Sorting Algorithms
--
* Bubble Sort - sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order
* Quick Sort - is an in-place sorting algorithm. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare. When implemented well, it can be somewhat faster than merge sort and about two or three times faster than heapsort. Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
* Merge Sort - In computer science, merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, and comparison-based sorting algorithm.
* Selection Sort - In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.
* Shell Sort - is an in-place comparison sort. It can be seen as either a generalization of sorting by exchange (bubble sort) or sorting by insertion (insertion sort).
* Insertion Sort - is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

Greedy Algorithms
--
* A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution, but, nonetheless, a greedy heuristic can yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.

Backtracking
-- 
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

Shortest Paths Algorithms

* Dijkstra’s Shortest Path - Dijkstra's algorithm solves the single-source shortest path problem with non-negative edge weight.
