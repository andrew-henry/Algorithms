# Algorithms
* In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a sequence of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation.

* In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

* Algorithms in c++
